Space Mines
===========

This is a WebGL implementation of "3d Minesweeper" using the *Three.js* 3D Library for _WebGL_.  
This is experimentation from book _Learning Three.js - the JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL_ by Jo Dirksen.

To run the app locally fron *nix, simply run the following command from the project root:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer <PORT>`

*PORT* should be 8080 or some other port you aren't currently using and would like to run you dev webserver.

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<PORT>/index.html` and you should see the app running there.

For Windows, one option is to install Node JS and run one of its local webservers.
